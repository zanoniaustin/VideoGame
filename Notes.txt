Shawn:
	Let me know when you are finished with whatever code you wanted to work through & merge.
	I figure we could use this file to Take any notes too
	
To-Do:
	-Put timing functions in place & on screen
	-set up a background (tile out sprites eventually but maybe just a single image for now)
	-add Character class
	-add weapon class
