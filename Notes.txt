	So for the sprite tiles I was thinking of having tiles1 or tiles2 as the flooring and then maybe one of the stone
	or wood as the walls. If you got any questions let me know.
	
To-Do:
	-Put timing functions in place & on screen
	-set up a background (tile out sprites eventually but maybe just a single image for now)
	-add Character class
	-add weapon class
