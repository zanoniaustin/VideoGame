Shawn:
	Let me know when you are finished with whatever code you wanted to work through & merge.
	I figure we could use this file to Take any notes too
	
Austin:
	So I have been taking a look at trying to get a timer up on the screen and getting the text to the screen is going to be the hard 	part so I am thinking of just having like a image that will represent out trigger for when the guy is moving.
	Like the image only comes on the screen when the guy is moving. I can explain a bit more on Monday.
	
To-Do:
	-Put timing functions in place & on screen
	-set up a background (tile out sprites eventually but maybe just a single image for now)
	-add Character class
	-add weapon class
