	So for the sprite tiles I was thinking of having tiles1 or tiles2 as the flooring and then maybe one of the stone
	or wood as the walls. If you got any questions let me know.
	
Shawn:
	Put in the background with tiles1 but Not really sure of a way to make it more easily scrollable (maybe ask castleton wednesday about it?)
	changed the game size to run = to a tileset
	
To-Do:
	-Put timing functions in place & on screen
	-set up a background (tile out sprites eventually but maybe just a single image for now)
	-add Character class
	-add weapon class
